				<h1>What is a Lie?</h1>
			</div>

			<p>What constitues a lie may vary from person to person, as the exact specifics of it can get a little muddy. A very general definition of a lie could be boiled down to <b>an action or statement which the liar knows is false or deceptive.</b></p>

			<p>Many philosophers have expanded upon this definition, throwing in their own ideas of what may constitue a lie. Sissela Bok, Professor of Philosophy at the Brandeis University, states that a lie is:</p>

			<blockquote><q>an intentionally deceptive message in the form of a statement</q></blockquote>

			<p>This definition explicitly states that the lie must communicate some information with the intention or knowledge of it being false. Given this definition, a list of criteria can be derived to formulate a concrete definition of what constitutes a lie:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>A lie must be a statement, either verbal or non-verbal, which communicates some information</li>
				<li>A lie must be told with the intention of deceiving the recipient</li>
				<li>A lie must be told knowing that the information is false</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Common misconceptions regarding the exact definition of a lie are that lies must be inherently wrong and that they're said with malicious intent. Advertising is a good example to disprove both misconceptions, considering that some advertisements may be <i>technically</i> correct, with the intention of simply gaining more business.</p>
