				<h1>Philosophers' Opinions</h1>
			</div>

			<p>Several philosophers in the past, such as Immanuel Kant, St. Augustine, and Thomas Aquinas, believed that lying was <i>always</i> morally wrong. As had been stated by St. Augustine:</p>

			<blockquote><q>Every liar says the opposite of what he thinks in his heart, with purpose to deceive.</q></blockquote>

			<p>However, while they all believed that lying was unjustifiable in any scenario, their opinions differed at when the lies should be forgiven.</p>

			</figure>

			<p>Immanuel Kant believed that no lies could be forgiven as every lie is done by taking advantage of the recipient's ignorance to the situation for the liar's own gain. Given that the only person with the knowledge that a lie is being told is the liar, assuming the recipient doesn't realise they're being lied to, every lie must be told with the initial intent to deceive the recipient, which alone is a morally unacceptable act.</p>

			<p>St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas both thought that lies <i>can</i> be forgiven, but at varying degrees. A similarity between both philosophers' stance on lying is that lies can be categorized in a list of severity, with the position of the lie in the list determining how forgivable it is. St. Augustine's list with the severity going from least severe to most severe:</p>

			<ol reversed = "true">
				<li>Lies that don't hurt anyone and protects someone from harm</li>
				<li>Lies that don't hurt anyone and allows the liar to make up for their lie</li>
				<li>Lies that don't hurt anyone and benefit someone</li>
				<li>Lies made as a joke or to tell people what they want to hear</li>
				<li>Lies made specifically to deceive</li>
				<li>Lies that hurt someone while benefiting someone else</li>
				<li>Lies that hurt someone</li>
				<li>Lies made about religion</li>
			</ol>

			<figure class = "fig-right">
				<img src = "phil4.jpg" class = "phil4">
				<figcaption>St. Thomas Aquinas 1225 - 1274</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>St. Thomas Aquinas had a similar idea, but on a much smaller scale (once again from least severe to most severe):</p>

			<ol reversed = "true">
				<li>Helpful lies, or lies told for incredibly trivial things</li>
				<li>Lies told as a joke</li>
				<li>Lies told with the intent to do harm</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Based on Aquinas' list, helpful lies and lies told as a joke would be pardonable but lies told to do harm would be unforgivable mortal sins.</p>
