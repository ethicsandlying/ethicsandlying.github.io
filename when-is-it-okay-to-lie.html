				<h1>When is it Okay to Lie?</h1>
			</div>
			
			<p>Assuming a consequentialist view on lying, there are specific cases where lying may be beneficial to the situation, as opposed to telling the truth. However, what cases would this be true? How can someone determine when it's okay to lie?</p>

			<p>Sissela Bok provides a "test" of sorts to determine whether it would be morally acceptable to lie in a specific scenario:</p>

			</figure>

			<blockquote><q>The test of publicity asks which lies, if any, would survive the appeal for justification to reasonable persons.</q></blockquote>

			<p>Essentially, if you were to ask several people with trust-worthy opinions, would they approve of the lie? Would they say it was justified?</p>

			<p>She expands upon this by including further detail into how to determine whether or not a lie is justifiable:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Are there any alternatives to lying?</li>
				<li>Can the lie be justified and would you be able to defend it if it's challenged?</li>
				<li>What would others think about the lie?</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Based on Bok's reasoning, it can be thought that a lie is justifiable if it can be presented as the best possible route to a group of reliable individuals, including yourself. Essentially, if it can be agreed that a lie will result in the best outcome and is done with the the intent of minimizing the possible damage to either person, than a lie can be deemed ethical.</p>
