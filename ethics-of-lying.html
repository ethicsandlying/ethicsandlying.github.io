				<h1>Ethics of Lying</h1>
			</div>

			<p>To say that someone lied is often met with a negative connotation - essentially, it's assumed that by lying, the liar had done something wrong.</p>

			<p>However, is it really that unethical to lie? Would it be considered wrong to lie, no matter the situation?</p>

			<p>The ethics behind lying, like most things in philosophy, is a difficult question to come to a conclusive answer for. Considering the varying opinions, experiences, and beliefs of people discussing such a topic, whether or not there's a "correct" answer simply comes down to what you choose to believe, making it a very open-ended discussion with no definitive answer. However, various opinions arise when discussing whether or not it is morally okay to lie.</p>

			<p>For some, lying is an absolute disgrace, no matter the situation. The opinion of some relies on their religious beliefs, such that our ability to speak is a gift from God to allow us to communicate with one another, meaning it would be sinful to defy this gift and use it to spread misinformation rather than using it for its intended use of communicating accurate information to another person.</p>

			<p>For others, lying is morally wrong for reasons beyond religion. Their justifications come from two main factors - the cosmic factors and the societal factors. The cosmic factors of their justifications state that in our world, there are several moral truths that are universally constant, all of which we have no control over. One of these moral truths is that lying, fundamentally, is morally wrong and cannot be justified by any means (this way of thinking is known as <b>deontology</b>). The societal factors of these justifications include several smaller reasons:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Lying degrades society as it lowers the trust of everyone</li>
				<li>Lying corrupts the liar, pushing them to make more lies in the future</li>
				<li>Lying uses the recipient of the lie as a "pawn" for the liar, decepting them for their own gains</li>
				<li>It diminishes the relationship between the liar and the recipient, assuming there was a relationship to begin with</li>
			</ul>

			<p><b>Consequentialists</b> (also known as <b>Utilitarians</b>) believe that the ends justify the means, holding the stance that if a lie leads to a better result than saying the truth, it's okay to lie in that scenario. However, considering how difficult it is to predict the outcome of certain situations, this view can be summarized by the generalized definition being that, for the most part, it's bad to lie, but there are certain cases where lying can be beneficial.</p>
