				<h1>Lying and Ethics</h1>
			</div>
			
			<p>Lying, among other things, is one of the inevitable aspects to life. It is human nature to lie, whether for good or for bad, considering its versatility as a tool to control any situation to our liking.</p>

			<p>However, understandably so, the ethics behind lying has been a topic widely discussed among philosophers for thousands of years. <i>Is it ethical to lie? If so, at what point would it be unethical? Does lying make you a bad person? If so, how many lies would you need to make to be considered a bad person?</i></p>

			<p>While most of these questions can be boiled down to simply being up to the opinion of the individual, the discussion among philosophers is a universal statement to sum up the morality of lying. While this may seem easy in concept, the complexities of the argument quickly begin to unfold as you explore it in greater detail. In addition, everyone has their own opinion on the ethics of lying, making it increasingly difficult to come to an absolute conclusion that satisfies everyone's opinions on the matter.</p>

			<p>With that being said, the ethics behind lying is a very developed field of philosophy, considering its vast history of ideas and arguments presented over time. While it may not have a definitive conclusion, one could certainly derive their own opinion on the matter based on the work developed by countless philosophers over thousands of years.</p>
